      <img src="./assets/images/illustration-five-stars.webp" alt="Five stars illustration">
      <p>Over 4,000 5-star review</p>
</div>
```
```css
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --black: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
    --yellow500: hsl(39, 100%, 71%);
    --yellow100: hsl(31, 66%, 93%);
    --purple500: hsl(256, 67%, 59%);
    --purple100: hsl(254, 88%, 90%);
